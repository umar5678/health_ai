## Introduction

This application aims to empower users to take control of their diet and health. By providing tools for food tracking, analysis, and personalized insights, it helps users make informed decisions about their nutrition and lifestyle.

## Features

- User registration and authentication.
- User profile creation and management (demographics, dietary preferences, allergies).
- Food image upload and AI-powered analysis (calorie and nutrient breakdown).
- Personalized diet plan generation (future feature).
- Health data tracking (weight, water intake, exercise).
- Progress visualization and analytics (charts, graphs) (future feature).
- Notifications and reminders (meal logging, water intake, exercise) (future feature).
- Admin panel for user management, content updates, and system monitoring (future feature).

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, [mention any UI libraries like Material-UI, Bootstrap, etc.]
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **AI Integration:** [Mention the AI API or library used, e.g., Cloud Vision API, Clarifai, custom model with TensorFlow/PyTorch]
- **Other:** [Mention any other libraries or tools, e.g., Axios for API calls, React Router for navigation, a state management library like Redux or Context API, bcrypt for password hashing, jsonwebtoken for authentication]
